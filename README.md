# Rusty Reindeer

## From SPJ's paper, the spec

> Santa repeatedly sleeps until wakened by either all of his nine reindeer, back
> from their holidays, or by a group of three of his ten elves. If awakened by the
> reindeer, he harnesses each of them to his sleigh, delivers toys with them and
> finally unharnesses them (allowing them to go off on holiday). If awakened by a
> group of elves, he shows each of the group into his study, consults with them on
> toy R&D and finally shows them each out (allowing them to go back to work).
> Santa should give priority to the reindeer in the case that there is both a
> group of elves and a group of reindeer waiting.
